# Most-Wanted-Project

Goal: You have been contracted to build a prototype for a person search for a top-secret government
project. You have been given access to an array of objects representing individuals. The prototype
should just use window.prompt and window.alert for the User Interface (UI). Although this isn’t typical
in production, you may use only two files for this project, an HTML file and a JS file for the application.
Technologies: JavaScript
Problem Solving Breakdown Task:
Before you start coding a specific user story that is highlighted in grey, you need to get with your team
and write an algorithm for that user story. This means breaking each user story down into steps. Please
submit to your instructor Slack channel once completed for approval to start coding on that specific user
story.
- Once you begin coding, it is important to tie tools that you have learned to those steps. For
example, do you need a variable to capture data? Is this a good place to use array.filter()?
Example of a user story broken down into steps:
- User Story: As a user, I want to be able to look up someone’s information after I find them with
the program (display values for the various traits of the found person).
- Steps
1. Take person found from application via searching by single/multiple criteria.
2. Display found person’s attributes (first name, last name, occupation, etc.)
3. Re-prompt user to perform a menu task
- Technical Implementation -- the goal is here to constantly ask yourself how to implement this
specific step into written code. For example, “how do I display a person’s attributes?”
1. Take person found from application via searching by single/multiple criteria. -- turn step
into code
2. Display found person’s attributes (first name, last name, occupation, etc.) -- turn step
into code
3. Re-prompt user to perform a menu task -- turn step into code
Highlight User Stories Task:
At the end of each day, you need to send a screenshot of your user stories to your instructor Slack
channel with the following highlights. The purpose of this is to constantly remain in control of your
timeline as well as ensuring you remain on task with completing features of the project:
- Highlight all user stories that are currently completed in green
- Highlight all user stories that are currently in the process of being worked on in yellow
- Highlight all user stories that you have yet to start in red
User Stories:
(5 points): As a developer, I want to make at least 15 consistent commits with good, descriptive
messages.
(5 points): As a developer, I want to run validation on any user input, ensuring that a user is reprompted when they provide invalid input.
(10 points): As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on a single criterion
- You should be able to find and return a list of people who match the search
(15 points): As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on multiple traits (up to a
maximum of five criteria at once).
- i.e., if you search for Gender: male and Eye Color: blue, you should get back a list of people who
match the search. In this case, it will be only people who are male with blue eyes.
(10 points): As a user, I want to be able to look up someone’s information after I find them with the
program (display values for the various traits of the found person).
(15 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants (display the
names of the descendants).
(15 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s immediate family
members, displaying the names of the family members and their relation to the found person.
- i.e., parents, spouse, siblings
Bonus
As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants (display the names of the
descendants), using recursion.
